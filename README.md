# SomeYTplayer
Title suggests it, some youtube player.
... There is really not much to read here.

It works by first stating how many songs you wish to play (leaving blank will just set it to 1)
And then adding the youtube link for each song.

The songs will then play in order, with a progress bar and some fancy stuff....
