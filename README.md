# SomeYTplayer
Title suggests it, some youtube player.
... There is really not much to read here.

It works by first stating how many songs you wish to play 
(leaving blank will just set it to 1) <-- this, ladies and gents, is a function i wanted to add. but i was too lazy to.\
And then just simply writing the name of each song to play it. in the highest possible quality of course.

It also has a **save system**, to save a song, simply type `save` when it asks how many songs to play.
`the save system is currently broken`



To **play saved** songs, type `custom` when it asks how many songs to play.

you can also manually add saved songs by going into the `saved songs` folder and simply **pasting your song** on a new line. **make sure to not remove the first link though.**

i changed it to use song names instead of links for the convenience of it, but links still work.





The songs will then play in order, with a progress bar and some fancy stuff.... 


**i know the code is awful, ill fix it some day.**
