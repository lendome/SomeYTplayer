# SomeYTplayer
Title suggests it, some youtube player.
... There is really not much to read here.

It works by first stating how many songs you wish to play (leaving blank will just set it to 1)
And then adding the youtube link for each song.

It also has a save system, to save a song, simply type `save` when it asks how many songs to play.
To play saved songs, type `custom` when it asks how many songs to play.





The songs will then play in order, with a progress bar and some fancy stuff.... 


**i know the code is awful, ill fix it some day.**
